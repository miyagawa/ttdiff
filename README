NAME
    ttdiff - find difference between structures of two TT templates

SYNOPSIS
      ttdiff file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
    "ttdiff" is a command line tool to find structured difference between
    two TT templates. It may be quite useful for checking before your
    co-working designer fixes up your bare-bone template into production
    ready design. What you should check is just run "ttdiff" against your
    template and the final template to see any typos or losing in migration
    are there.
